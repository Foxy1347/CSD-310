Project Requirements
Information
The intent of this project is to develop a pilot program that implements a solution to a case study. You will be working in groups for this project. Each group will work together to accomplish all aspects of the project. How you divide up the work is up to you. The group, as a whole, needs to come to an agreement on each element of the deliverables. The deliverables for each milestone should be uploaded to your group discussion forum, and pushed to each team member's GitHub account.
The case studies and an overview of all deliverables can be found under the "Project Info & Case Studies" list item to your left. Group areas can be found under the "Groups" list item to your left.
